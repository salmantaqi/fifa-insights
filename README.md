# FIFA 19 Insights: Player Attributes vs. Wages

This project investigates the correlation between player characteristics and remuneration within the FIFA 19 video game context. We employed a dataset comprising more than 18,000 players and executed statistical examinations including the z-test and chi-square test. Our analyses have revealed disparities in compensation among various player positions and skill tiers. These findings hold the potential to serve as valuable insights for soccer teams, aiding them in making judicious choices.
